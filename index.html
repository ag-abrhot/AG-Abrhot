        <h1>Enlightenment</h1>
          <p> <br>
            Un-enlightened individual is guided by random and
            hypothetical perception that all he lives and
            practices suited to him/her assumption that the
            words of the superiors are end of Knowledge and
            source of prosperous destiny. However, everything
            could turnout to be the revers that it could cost him
            his priceless life and to least his health. This
            conception applies in every aspect of life as to the
            kind of food you eat, when to eat, how much to eat,
            what kind financial choices you make, what kind of
            skills to develop, what political decisions you make ,
            and how all these affect you positively/negatively
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            An enlightened mind emancipate you from world of
            perception and from being victim of manipulation to
            realm of reality and new paradigm of possibility.
            As I have already broke the vail of impossibility to
            possibility, you can brake all barriers through
            awareness towards peaceful and joyful life of no pain
            and suffering. I fully cured from type-2 diabetes
            despite the conventional medicine claims that Type-
            2 diabetes is Chronic and progressive disease. My
            limitless determination helped me to understand the
            truth behind the disease (the root cause of the
            disease), I read about 25 books related to diabetes
            with deep-sited ambition. Finally, I found many root
            causes of the disease and many healing methods
            from the books wrote by those bright researchers
            and scientists already practiced on their patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, I summarised and translated about 18
            books to only about 150 pages my Tigrigna book,
            which says “Curing Diabetes”. Since our people has
            low habit and appetite to reading books, I hope that
            they will benefit from this condensed relatively few
            pages but valuable book.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Further explanation, debates, advices from
            professionals and overall interactive exchange of
            experiences, we opened this website and YouTube
            on the name of “Abrohot” which means Enlightment.

            Please follow, correct, and give feedback so that many
            can benefit. Avoid negative energy and think
            positive in order for us all to progress.
